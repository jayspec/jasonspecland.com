We got back from Virginia on Monday afternoon, and I&#8217;ve been procrastinating writing and posting the photos about it. However, an incredibly delightful Christmas-wrapped bag of awesome has just been dropped into my lap, and I can not let another moment go by without telling you about it.

It is &#8220;Sleigh Ride in Bora Bora&#8221; by my wonderful friends Melissa Axel and James Jacoby. (And some of their friends who I&#8217;m sure are actually wonderful themselves, but I&#8217;ve never actually met.)

[Get the song now](http://www.sleighrideinborabora.com). No, seriously. Do it.

It&#8217;s kitschy and delightful, and I double-dog-dare you not to smile while listening to it. It is immediately jumping head-first into our family Christmas music rotation. Not that we really had one before, but thanks to this song, we&#8217;re totally starting one.
