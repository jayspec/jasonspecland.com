**Thursday, August 17, 11 PM, The PIT Underground:** I perform&#8230; ALL BY MYSELF! At the [Solo Improv Showcase](http://thepit-nyc.com/event/2017-08-17-solo-improv-showcase) hosted by Solo Improv guru Mike Brown. $7.

**Saturday, August 19, 3-6 PM, Simple Studios:** Drop on in to my [Drop-In Class](https://thepit-nyc.com/drop-in-practices/)! Get some improv reps! Have some improv fun! $30, or $20 if you have a current PIT student ID.

**Saturday, August 26, 5PM, Henry Heymann Theater, Pittsburgh, PA:** The Austen Family Improv Players at the [Pittsburgh Comedy Festival](http://pittsburghcomedyfestival.org/). Super-excited about this one! I get to go back to my old college town to lay down some Regency-Era manners. I just hope my order of &#8216;O&#8217; Fries doesn&#8217;t drip ketchup on my cravat. $10
