Since I was tired of conflating my two online personalities here, I&#8217;ve created a new blog about SharePoint and other technologies that I work and fool around with. Â If you wish to follow it, you can find it at <http://www.jayspecthetech.com>. Â If you&#8217;re Twitter inclined, you can follow @jayspecthetech. The rest of you improv nerds and people actually interested in my personal life, you can stay right where you are. Â ðŸ™‚
