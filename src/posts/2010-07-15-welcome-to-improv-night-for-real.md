As any reader of this blog already knows, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of improv at the PIT lately. Up until now, it&#8217;s all been open jams and class shows. But no more, my friends! Like an improv Voltron, we&#8217;ve assembled the best parts of my previous classes to create a Robeast-destroying whole. Except that in this case, instead of destroying a Robeast with a flaming sword, we create a really funny show on the spot.

We are Jabberwocky, and we are part of the Dream NYC show.

Jabberwocky is:

Kathryn Dunn  
Daniel Operman  
Mary Guiteras  
Colin Longstaff  
Nathaniel Bryan  
Shayne Newton Grier  
Jason Specland 

We are performing at:

The People&#8217;s Improv Theater  
154 W 29th St.  
NYC

Doors open at 9:20, Show starts at 9:30!!

$5 (Free for any improv student with a student ID from _any_ improv-teaching institution!)

Be there, or get eaten.
