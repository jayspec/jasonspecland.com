This is mostly for my own educational benefit.  Feel free to ignore, especially if you&#8217;re not into improv esoterics.

Yesterday evening was my fourth improv class, and my third attempt at performance on the stage of the PIT during their Wednesday night Improdome free-for-all.  To recap: My first performance was a miserable failure.  My second was an encouraging success.   Last night, my third performance, has turned out to be an instructive failure.

It&#8217;s interesting to discover that the primary problem that ended my improv &#8220;career&#8221; before it could really start is the same primary problem I&#8217;m experiencing now:  Not trusting my partners leads me to jump headlong into huge initiations and I kind of &#8220;take over&#8221; the scene, which never actually goes well.

Sometimes I think the solution to that problem is to hang back a bit, and wait for my partner&#8217;s initiation.  That&#8217;s somewhat useful, but not entirely so, especially when you _do_ have a strong initiation in mind, and your partner does not.  And if your partner does not have a strong initiation, the panic sets in, and there goes the trust, and then&#8230; things don&#8217;t go well.

After analyzing my performance both in class and on stage last night, I think that it&#8217;s not strong initiations I should fear.  It&#8217;s initiations that are not grounded in emotional honesty.  My mind conjures the situation so fast that it doesn&#8217;t take the time to put any flesh on the bones of the character, which comes out as a broad stereotype at best.  Taking just a brief moment to imbue the character with some emotional truth will probably help a lot.

There&#8217;s a reason that the bible of the craft is called &#8220;Truth in Comedy.&#8221;  When I got home last night, I pulled the book from my shelf.  I haven&#8217;t read it in years.  It&#8217;s time to crack it open, before I set foot on the improv stage again.
