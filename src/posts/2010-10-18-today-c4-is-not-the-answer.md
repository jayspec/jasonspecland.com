I still support President Obama (especially in lieu of any non-crazy alternatives at the moment). And Lord knows I love me some Mythbusters. So one would think that the combination of the two would be a Reece&#8217;s Peanut Butter Cup of awesome. However, I was a bit disturbed by this part of the [press release](http://press.discovery.com/us/dsc/press-releases/2010/president-obama-announces-walk-role-discovery--940/):

> Said President Obama from the White House, &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to welcome Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, known as the MYTHBUSTERS. I can announce today that I taped a special guest appearance for their show, although I didn&#8217;t get to blow anything up&#8230; I was a little frustrated about that.&#8221; 

Coming from any other celebrity, that would be downright humorous. But I&#8217;m not exactly sure that the man with his finger on the button, who has personally ordered Predator drone strikes in Pakistan, and who is the Comander in Chief of the continuing war in Afghanistan should be so glib about the excitement he gets from blowing things up.
