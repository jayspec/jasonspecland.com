Over the past year, I&#8217;ve made a lot of new friends. However, many of these new friends don&#8217;t know how incredibly awesome and talented my wife is. Sure, they hear second-hand accounts from me, but nothing beats seeing the awesomeness live. That&#8217;s why all of you (and I _do_ mean all of you) should go see The Icky House Club this Saturday night!

(A video of the Icky House Club performing appears below. If you&#8217;re seeing this somewhere where that video doesn&#8217;t appear, just follow the links to the original source. You won&#8217;t regret it. Well, maybe you will if your significant other sees how sexy the members of this band are and abandons you immediately to become a groupie.)
