I just edited my previous post about our upcoming Vorpal shows to indicate the location of our next show. It&#8217;s at Sparks Cafe and Arts Center, at 161 W 22nd St. Very astute readers may notice that this is the location of the former Upright Citizens Brigade theater. It&#8217;s a place I haven&#8217;t been back to in a long time&#8230; a long time&#8230;

It is the place where I _learned_ long form improv in the first place. I remember being in that theater for an all-hands meeting when they first got the place. I thought, &#8220;This is going to be something big.&#8221; I was right. It is the place where I had my greatest improv triumph when I was cast on a house team. It is the place where I had my greatest improv failure when I was cast off of a house team. In a cloud of my own depression, I bailed on the wave just as it began to crest and it took me about eight years to recover&#8230;

In about a week, I&#8217;ll be performing in the very place where my improv career took off and, like Icarus, flew to close to the sun and came crashing to the ground. Except I didn&#8217;t die. And there were no wings involved. Except for the wings of the stage. And the UCB stage didn&#8217;t have wings. And the entire interior is probably gutted so even if there were wings they&#8217;d have been long gone. And the actual UCB has long since moved. Twice.

So, come see me perform at the place of my long form improv birth. Perhaps I can put some of those performance ghosts to rest once and for all&#8230;
