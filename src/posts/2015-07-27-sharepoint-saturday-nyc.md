I had a total blast speaking at SharePoint Saturday this past weekend. I admit I was slightly terrified at the prospect of speaking in front of a crowd of seasoned IT professionals&#8230; I was worried I&#8217;d get something wrong and provoke the ire of the crowd. But, as it turned out, the crowd was delightful and enthusiastic.

My presentation was entitled, &#8220;Love in the Time of Javascript: Useful Patterns for Client-Side Code in SharePoint.&#8221; A friend of mine from Google said that comparing javascript to cholera was unfair to cholera&#8230;

It went well, but I experienced particular delight in a trick I pulled that worked gloriously. Everyone who&#8217;s been to these sessions knows that people kind of drift in and out of them, as they discover that the session they&#8217;re attending isn&#8217;t exactly what they&#8217;re looking for, and that another session going on at the same time might be more fulfilling. Nothing wrong with that. This ain&#8217;t the theater, but it&#8217;s still slightly distracting for presenters.

So I thought, &#8220;How long would it take someone to determine that my presentation was not for them?&#8221; I guesstimated that it&#8217;d be about twelve minutes. So, before the presentation began, I wrote &#8220;9:12&#8221; on one of my business cards, and handed it out to a gentleman in the front row.

I began my presentation, and, lo and behold, someone starts making his way out. I glance at the clock on my presenter computer. 9:12 exactly! I say to the man in the front row, &#8220;Sir, what time does it say on that card I gave you?&#8221;

&#8220;9:12.&#8221;

&#8220;What time is it now?&#8221;

&#8220;9:12.&#8221;

&#8220;9:12! First walkout! I called it!&#8221;

I swear upon my very life that I didn&#8217;t pre-arrange it with the guy who left.

Oh yeah, I spoke a bit about SharePoint and javascript, too. But clearly, pulling off a magic trick was the highlight of my SharePoint Saturday.

For those who are interested, here is the PowerPoint presentation for [Love in the Time of Javascript: Useful Patterns for Client-Side Code in SharePoint](http://jasonspecland.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Love-in-the-Time-of-Javascript.pptx).
