Did you miss the Vorpal show last Monday at the PIT? Well, if you did here&#8217;s your opportunity to make up for it! We&#8217;re performing at Wonderland, the huge, gorgeous artist collective in Astoria. Hey, why don&#8217;t I just cut and paste the press release? Control-V to the rescue!

Seriously, guys, it&#8217;s going to be totally amazing. The Wonderland space is one of the seven wonders of the Astorian world, and all the groups are really damn funny. The party afterwards is going to be half the fun.
