I scanned this drawing last week, with the intention of posting it here. At the time, Benjamin explained to me what it was, and I thought it was terribly cute. Looking at it now, I&#8217;ve forgotten what he said and can&#8217;t quite fathom why he calls it, &#8220;Alice In Wonderland.&#8221; I therefore present it without further comment:
