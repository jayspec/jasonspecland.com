**This workshop has been postponed. I will update here when a new date has been chosen.**

<strike>I&#8217;ll be doing my &#8220;Listening and Reacting with Emotion&#8221; workshop on Sunday, May 27th, from 1-4 PM at Simple Studios. The workshop is associated with the Armory, and not the PIT who is my usual employer. But just the same, any old person can join in for the usual price of $20. (Armory Performers only pay $12! So if you&#8217;re an Armory performer, and have been waiting to take one of my workshops, this would be a super-great chance!)
