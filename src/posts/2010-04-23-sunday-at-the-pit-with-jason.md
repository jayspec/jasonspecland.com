My journey of improv redemption continues apace. My Level 3 class is about to conclude, and like all classes at the PIT, we conclude with a show (actually, two). I&#8217;d be mighty appreciative if one or two of you could be there with me to share it.

My teacher for this level, [Scott Eckert](http://www.thepit-nyc.com/performers/seckert.html), deserves special mention. I must admit that I&#8217;ve had a man-crush on him from class one. Not only is he a spectacular performer (as all the PIT teachers have been) but he is wonderfully enthusiastic about teaching, and shares a lot of my philosophy. I&#8217;ve always said, &#8220;The things that make good theater make good improv.&#8221; It&#8217;s delightfully satisfying to have a teacher who not only understands that, but is passionate about it. He gave me another pithy insight that I&#8217;ll file away into my box of performance truisms: &#8220;Comedy is the failure of drama.&#8221;

Please come and see us so we don&#8217;t perform to a room full of empty, soulless, unlaughing chairs. 

Performance dates and times:  
Sunday, April 25, 2010 at 8:00 PM
