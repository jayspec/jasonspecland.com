So, last night was the world premiere of my new improv group &#8220;Jabberwocky.&#8221; I can&#8217;t tell you how exciting it is to be in a real group again. When I was invited into this group, and saw the list of other players, I was excited because I knew all of these people were talented. My excitement was realized from the moment we started warming up backstage. Things just work so well when everyone&#8217;s on the same page!

We started with an opening called &#8220;The Conversation&#8221; which is pretty much what it is. We get a suggestion from the audience, and proceed to have a five-minute group conversation about it. I was wary of this, because who wants to watch people sit around and talk for five minutes, but it worked surprisingly well. It was entertaining and generated a boatload of specific information and themes. And since the players aren&#8217;t worried about participating in some sort of theatrical game, it&#8217;s much easier to process that information. Also, as I mentioned before, having a talented group of folks you trust all on the same page makes a world of difference.

As far as my own scenework goes, I was a tad disappointed. In my main scene, I played a Rabbi who was marking all kinds of wildly inappropriate food as Kosher. My partner and I played the &#8220;what funny things can we make kosher&#8221; game for a few minutes, but it wasn&#8217;t as much about the relationship as I&#8217;d like and so it required excessive invention and didn&#8217;t have legs beyond that initial scene.

We were told in advance that we&#8217;d get 20 minutes, and we kind of built our form around that time, but we were cut off around 10-15 minutes into our set. That&#8217;s disappointing, not because we crave more stage time, but because our form didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to wrap up and make the connections that make longform improv so satisfying.

Major thanks to Don and Alex for coming to our show, and _unbelievably_ major thanks go to Chris, who has come to just about every improv show I&#8217;ve ever done.
