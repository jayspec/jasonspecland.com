This is a pretty new blog (or rather, a new location for a pretty old blog), and I&#8217;ve already spent a great deal of time extolling the virtues of my beautiful and talented wife, Paula.

Well, I&#8217;m going to have to do that again, so bear with me.

My wife is part of a truly wonderful musical group known as &#8220;The Icky House Club.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve actually known all three members of this group for quite a while.  Naturally, I&#8217;ve known my wife for a good long time.  Carlos, the other singer, is a very good friend of mine with the most gorgeous tenor voice you&#8217;ve ever heard.  We were in a production of &#8220;Children of Eden&#8221; together.  (He played Adam.  I played third schlub from the left.)  Mickey, the guitarist, front-man, songwriter, and _other_ other singer is also a good, long-time friend, although I&#8217;ve actually known him as a performer and songwriter for longer than I have as a friend.  He, too, is brilliant.

The musical result is a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts.  I&#8217;ve seen different incarnations of Mickey&#8217;s bands before, but Mickey, Paula, and Carlos make a perfect trio of vocal harmonies.  It&#8217;s as smooth and rich as butter wrapped in silk.

I don&#8217;t go around plugging shows all that often, and I wish there was a way to convince you that it&#8217;s not just because Paula&#8217;s my wife, and Carlos and Mickey are my friends.  They really are _that_ good.  Please, if you can, do me a favor and go check out their show.  I promise, upon my honor, you won&#8217;t regret it.
