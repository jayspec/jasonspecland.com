To elaborate a a bit on what I posted yesterday:

This is my second time through the audition process at the PIT, and the first time I&#8217;ve been through significant cuts. Many people I love, including half of Technicolor, won&#8217;t be around for this cycle. 

It hurts. I know. I&#8217;ve been there.

When I was put on a Harold team at UCB*, I was well beyond cloud nine &#8212; I was on cloud a hundred and seventy-four and had a leather steamer trunk covered in stickers indicating the many clouds I&#8217;d been on. When I was cut a short time later, I was bereft.

At first I thought, &#8220;It&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m a bit emotional now, but I just need to take a break from this place.&#8221; But then the break became a hiatus. The hiatus became &#8220;Whatever happened to&#8230;?&#8221; Before I knew it, I hadn&#8217;t done longform improv in ten years. 

Let me tell you: This is, seriously, one of the biggest regrets of my life.

If you need to take time, go ahead and take some time. But please, PLEASE don&#8217;t make the same mistake I made. Don&#8217;t abandon your craft. Make things happen. Persevere. Be great. I have faith in you.

* Back then, this was not quite the amazing accomplishment it is today. On the UCB retrospective interview that was recently published, someone said, &#8220;Anyone who could stand got on a house team.&#8221; I could stand. Barely.
