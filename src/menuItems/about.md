Jason Specland is a teacher and performer of improv comedy, a software architect, a public speaker, and a father who lives in Astoria, Queens. He grew up in South Florida, where he hosted a retro-80&#8217;s radio show in the early 1990&#8217;s when no one cared. He once worked at a grocery store, where for some reason he agreed to dress up in a Barney the Dinosaur costume to amuse the kids.

Jason has performed at Upright Citizens Brigade, ComedySportz, and at the Jekyll and Hyde Club as a mad scientist to scare tourists. He has been on many house teams at the Peoples Improv Theater, where he is currently a teacher.  He has performed with The Austen Family Improv Players and GEORGE/MARTHA: An improvised &#8220;Who&#8217;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&#8221; Today, he can be seen performing at The Armory with his house team "Falcon Toss."

When he&#8217;s not making up comedy on the spot, Jason is a Cloud Solution Architect for Microsoft. He has spoken at SharePoint Saturday, the ShareNYC User Group, and the Insider Dev Tour on all kinds of fun technical topics.
