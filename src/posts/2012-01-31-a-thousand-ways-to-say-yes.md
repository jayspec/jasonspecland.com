In my obligatory &#8220;Hamlet&#8217;s Advice to the House Team Auditioners&#8221; post on Facebook, I said:

> Break legs. Relax. Be yourself. Say yes. Listen and react emotionally. Commit. Feel something. SAY YES! 

I said, &#8220;Say yes&#8221; twice, once in ALL CAPS. To which everyone who&#8217;s ever taken a Level Zero improv class, or even walked by a room where an improv class was taking place replied, &#8220;Well, DUH!&#8221;

But saying yes is more than just not saying no.

Sure, at the level at which people are auditioning for house teams, you rarely hear:

A: This is a pink unicorn.  
B: No, it&#8217;s not! It&#8217;s a yellow washing machine!

Good. You passed Level One. Congratulations.

If I have any improv knowledge to impart, it is because I stand on the shoulders of giants. And if my knowledge has any breadth, it is because I&#8217;m standing on the shoulders of a lot of giants, all lined up together like the Giants defensive line during a goal-line stand.* So this is what some of these giants have taught me about the many ways of saying yes:

From Del (in the canonical text &#8220;Truth in Comedy&#8221;), and from several of his disciples, I learned Yes, and&#8230; Just like everyone else.

From [Will Hines at Improv Nonsense](http://improvnonsense.tumblr.com/) I learned that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING is an offer to be accepted. Specifically I learned the power of saying &#8220;Yes!&#8221; to directed questions. Again, once you get beyond Level 1, you don&#8217;t get questions like, &#8220;Who are you? What is that?&#8221; But how many times have you seen this:

A: Sorry I&#8217;m late, honey.  
B: Are you having an affair?  
A: No, I was just stuck in traffic. God, you&#8217;re so suspicious!

or

A: I forgot to turn off the oven!  
B: What are you retarded?  
A: No, I was just in such a hurry to meet you that I forgot.

Mr. Hines posits that these questions are weak, unsure offers, but offers just the same and 99.9% of the time the answer should be, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;

A: Sorry I&#8217;m late, honey.  
B: Are you having an affair?  
A: Yes, I am. I was wondering how long it&#8217;d be until you found out.

or

A: I forgot to turn off the oven!  
B: What are you, retarded?  
A: Yes, a little. I normally cope well enough but you put so much pressure on me that I forgot my &#8220;coping with daily tasks&#8221; training.

(If you want to play a fun mini-game, just watch my lips during another team&#8217;s improv performance and count how many times I mouth the words, &#8220;Just say yes!&#8221;)

From [Rich Talarico](http://www.richtalarico.com/), at his workshop at the PIT, I learned that it&#8217;s rarely the best move to be surprised by something. A shocking revelation is a big offer, and a response of surprise is like a &#8220;Yes, but&#8230;&#8221; that takes several lines. For example:

A: I&#8217;m having an affair.  
B: WHAT? I don&#8217;t believe it! With who? How long has this been going on?

Sure, points for honest reactions, but we only have a short time to move this scene forward. But what happens if we&#8217;re not surprised?

A: I&#8217;m having an affair.  
B: I know. With Mrs. Schmidt next door. She&#8217;s kind of frumpy. Frankly I thought you could have done better.

I think the more compelling scene lies down the second path.

From [Oscar Montoya](http://internetisoz.tumblr.com/) I learned that while &#8220;Yes, and&#8230;&#8221; is useful &#8220;Yes, because&#8230;&#8221; focuses the scene. Rather than:

A: The souffle has fallen.  
B: And the dish is cracked.  
A: And the oven&#8217;s on fire.

How about:

A: The souffle has fallen.  
B: That&#8217;s probably because you were jumping on your pogo stick right next to the oven while it was baking.

And finally, from [Chris Roberti](http://chrisroberti.tumblr.com/) I learned that it&#8217;s always more interesting to be vulnerable than to be guarded. How does that tie into this post&#8217;s theme of saying yes? Well, I weave that into Oscar&#8217;s advice to create the basis of my entire improv philosophy: &#8220;Yes, because I&#8217;m vulnerable.&#8221;

A: The souffle has fallen.  
B: All of my cooking has been a failure since Sheila left&#8230;

As always, the path of knowledge is never-ending. This is by no means an exhaustive examination of the myraid ways of saying yes. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be learning new ways of saying yes until I&#8217;m too senile to perform and the other people at the theater have an uncomfortable discussion to decide who has to tell the old man that maybe it&#8217;s time to retire. 

But until then, please, SAY YES!

* Go Giants!!!
