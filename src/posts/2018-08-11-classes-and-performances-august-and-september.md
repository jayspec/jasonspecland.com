I&#8217;ll be teaching the following drop-in classes at the PIT:

Sun, 8/12: 6-9 PM  
Sun, 9/2: 6-9 PM  
Fri, 9/7: 7-10 PM

As per usual, the classes take place at Simple Studios, and cost $20 in cash. See you there!

I&#8217;m going to be on vacation for two weeks in August, so I won&#8217;t have many performances, but my Armory team, Falcon Toss (caw!) is performing on:

Fri, 8/31: 9 PM  
Fri, 9/14: 9 PM

As per also usual, the shows take place at The Tank and cost $5 in cash or $6 with a credit card. See you there, too, hypothetical person who goes to all of my stuff!
