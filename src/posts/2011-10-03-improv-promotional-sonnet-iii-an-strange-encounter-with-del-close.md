This is the third in a series of sonnets for the purpose of promoting my improv shows at the PIT. In case the sonnet isn&#8217;t clear on the details, come see &#8220;Technicolor&#8221; every Monday at 9 PM in the PIT Underground.

Last night I tossed and turned in fevered dreams  
In which I saw the ghost of sainted Del.  
And from his gut erupted painful screams,  
&#8220;What mortal dares to claim he improvs well!?&#8221;  
&#8220;Tis I,&#8221; squeaked I. &#8220;And who are you?&#8221; he growled,  
&#8220;To strut about, my artform to defile?&#8221;  
He called his improv henchmen and he scowled,  
&#8220;Another improviser for the pile.&#8221;  
&#8220;Tis I!&#8221; I screamed, &#8220;And and in me is enough,  
A lifetime&#8217;s slings and arrows in my soul!&#8221;  
The ghost he grinned, and vanished in a puff,  
And whispered thus: &#8220;You&#8217;re ready for your role.&#8221;  
What other apparitions will I see?  
Find out at nine, before The Faculty.
