You&#8217;d think that, being a They Might Be Giants fan myself, that I&#8217;d pushed Benjamin into loving TMBG more than anything else in the world. Unless there&#8217;s a genetic component to musical taste, (which has been confirmed to be not true by generations of teenagers) Benjamin has picked up this love all on his own.

Case in point&#8230;
