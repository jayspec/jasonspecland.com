Based on recent experiences, some new rules to live my life by:

**1. My worth as a human being does not depend on the quality of my performance.**

I&#8217;m no good at judging myself by them anyway. A good show results in an inner monologue that says, &#8220;Hey, that wasn&#8217;t too bad,&#8221; and continues on its merry way. A bad one results in days upon days of depression and self loathing.

**2. Sleep is important. I will not neglect this essential need.**

The difference in my mood and productivity after a good night&#8217;s sleep is astounding. Why do I keep neglecting this essential function?

**3. When I perform, I will do so with purpose and conviction.**

I&#8217;ve performed on stage consistently my entire adult life, and I have performed improv for most of that time. I do not need &#8220;stage time&#8221; for its own sake. If I get up on a stage it will be in service to a show with a clear purpose, and not just to &#8220;screw around.&#8221; Following through with Rule 3 will probably help with Rule 1.

**4. I will work towards my dreams every day.**

My life is too short and too valuable to screw around doing nothing. The Internet is a drug that works by stimulating the part of the brain that craves novel information. I will not let this drug enslave my mind and obliterate my dreams.

**5. I will clearly envision and refine my dreams every week.**

I will take time to steer the ship, and make sure that the things that I&#8217;m doing are pushing me towards goals that I actually want to accomplish. The vivid vision of the artist I want to be will propel me through the agonizing self-doubt that comes from actually doing creative work.
