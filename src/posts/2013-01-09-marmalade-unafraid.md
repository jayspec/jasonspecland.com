Here&#8217;s a video of last night&#8217;s show: &#8220;Marmalade: Unafraid,&#8221; the improvised two-person show I do with the amazing and delightful Kathryn Dunn.



When I think of how wonderfully fun and exciting it is to work with Kathryn, it&#8217;s almost like I can sense the lightning when Laurel met Hardy, or when Aykroyd met Belushi (without the drugs), or when Burns met Allen (without the romance, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m already real-life married), or when chocolate met peanut butter.
