So yesterday evening, we had our first level 3 class show at the PIT. Everyone seemed to think it went well, but as usual I&#8217;m beating myself up over missed opportunities. Fortunately, our class was sufficiently large that we did two mini-shows, and I got to do both. I wasn&#8217;t very happy with myself in the first one, but I feel like I picked up a bit more steam in the second.

Scott (our teacher) gave notes and hung out with us afterwards. I asked him about my ritual post-show self-flagellation. His reply: &#8220;First, don&#8217;t. Second&#8230; don&#8217;t.&#8221; So perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t. Or perhaps he was drunk. Or perhaps both.

If you missed the Sunday show, you can still see our final class show next Thursday. Specifically:  
Thursday, May 6, 2010 at 7:00 PM
