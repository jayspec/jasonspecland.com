If you like to see me make stuff up on stage, then you will have a lot of opportunities to see me do so this week.

&#8220;True to Form&#8221;  
Friday, February 3, 2012 (TODAY!)

A monthly show in which we explore the structure of improv by performing unique forms provided by the community and abroad. This month we&#8217;re doing &#8220;The Ghost,&#8221; &#8220;Memento,&#8221; and &#8220;The Master.&#8221;

7:00 PM, UNDER St. Marks, $(I don&#8217;t know, but it can&#8217;t be _that_ expensive&#8230;)

Improv, with puppets! If you like seeing me do improv while holding a cloth doll over my head, then you will love this show!
