**UPDATE**: The snow has abated from the sky, but not the streets or subways. This show is **CANCELLED**. See you in January for &#8220;Through the Laughing Glass IV!&#8221;

Once the snow abates, you will need to poke your head out from beneath the tons of accumulated powder. You&#8217;ve been snowbound in your claustrophobic New York apartment for days. You will be desperate for mirth and merriment. Perhaps of the improvised kind&#8230;

That&#8217;s where we come in.

VORPAL! Monday, December 27, 2010 at the People&#8217;s Improv Theater! 

Where&#8217;s that? 154 West 29th Street, between 6th and 7th Ave.* Here, let me draw you a map:

*It won&#8217;t be here for much longer, but it will be there for this performance.

With special guests:

Kelly Davis  
No Laugh Track Required  
BAY-SIDE  
The Heat Miser (booking still tentative)

$5 buys you all this comedy in a heated theater! Why, that&#8217;s cheaper than heating oil!

Vorpal is: 

Kathryn Dunn  
Jason A. Specland  
Colin Longstaff  
Daniel Operman  
A Partridge in a Pear Tree (booking still tentative)
