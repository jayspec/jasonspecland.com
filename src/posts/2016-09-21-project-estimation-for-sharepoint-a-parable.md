EXT. OUTSIDE THE JUNGLE, DAY

An intrepid treasure hunter and his local guide stand trepidatiously outside of a dark, mysterious, wild jungle.

**Treasure Hunter:** How long will it take for us to get through the jungle?  
**Guide:** It&#8217;s hard to say. The jungle is filled with dangerous traps and difficult terrain.  
**Treasure Hunter:** Okay, how long will it take to get two miles through the jungle?  
**Guide:** Seriously, it&#8217;s hard to say. I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to encounter&#8230;  
**Treasure Hunter:** Just ballpark it for me.  
**Guide:** Okay, well I&#8217;m really not certain, so I&#8217;m going to have to assume the worst&#8230; Three days?  
**Treasure Hunter:** Three days!? To go two miles!? What are you, incompetent or something?  
**Guide:** Okay, if everything goes absolutely perfectly&#8230; A day, maybe? But don&#8217;t hold me to that&#8230;

CUT TO: Two days later&#8230;

EXT. INSIDE A PIT TRAP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE, DAY

**Treasure Hunter:** We&#8217;re a day over budget. I&#8217;m not paying you for this, you know.
