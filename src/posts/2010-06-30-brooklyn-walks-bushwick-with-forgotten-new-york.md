Since my appetites for historical walks and physical pain are apparently insatiable, I spent Sunday on the [Forgotten New York](http://www.forgotten-ny.com) walking tour of Bushwick. I won&#8217;t go into extreme detail about the tour itself: That ground will no doubt be better covered both on Forgotten New York and on the blogs of the plethora of attendees who&#8217;ve forgotten more about New York history than I&#8217;ll ever know.

Years ago, when I was roommates with my friend Duncan, we were watching a marathon of TV shows in a series about the history of booze in the United States. There was an episode on cocktails, an episode on beer, an episode on wine, etc. In every episode, they&#8217;d eventually come to the 1920&#8217;s, and the narrator&#8217;s voice would turn ominous and say, &#8220;&#8230;and then came Prohibition!&#8221; And so the fortunes of the boozemakers would take a turn for the worse&#8230;

Well, that&#8217;s kind of what happened to Bushwick. The Germans immigrated here, built all kinds of breweries, made piles of money with which they built mansions&#8230; and then came Prohbition! If I ever make a fortune in a product that is known to cause moral panic, I&#8217;ll be sure to diversify.

My impression of the area is much the same as Bed-Stuy. Bushwick is a gorgeous renaissance of achingly beautiful brownstones, punctuated with depressing pockets of poverty and neglect. While we were walking, a gentleman of the neighborhood shouted out, &#8220;What!? They&#8217;re bringing tourists to Bushwick!?&#8221; I _wanted_ to say, &#8220;Yes. You live in a beautiful and historic neighborhood. You should open your eyes to the breathtaking architectural artistry all around you.&#8221; But what I _actually_ said was nothing at all.

One of the most exciting parts of the trip for me was meeting several of my internet heroes. I met Kevin Walsh, the proprietor of Forgotten New York and author of the book by the same name. I met Mitch Waxman of [the Newtown Pentacle](http://newtownpentacle.com/), a half-historical, half-paranoid exploration of the neglected semi-industrial cemetary area around Newtown Creek. I met Miss Heather of [New York Shitty](http://newyorkshitty.com), whom I&#8217;d actually met briefly once before since, by amazing coincidence, I work with her husband. After most of the tour broke up, we had a quick dinner at a Mexican/Italian (yes, really) restaurant in Williamsburg, which was kind of a real-life version of celebrity dinner, except with New York neighborhood bloggers.

I don&#8217;t know when the next Forgotten New York tour is, or where it&#8217;s going to be. I just know I&#8217;m going to be there&#8230;
