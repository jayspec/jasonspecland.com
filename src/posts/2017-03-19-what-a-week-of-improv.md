If you had an itchin&#8217; to see me perform improv, this is your lucky week! Just about every group I perform with is playing this week.

**BUCKET OF FUN**: Sunday, March 19th (today!), 7:00 PM at the PIT LOFT (154 W. 29th St., betw. 6th and 7th Ave.). My house team REGINA goes up against Latinx in a game show that pits improv teams against one another in a fun competition.

**REGINA**: Monday, March 20th (tomorrow!), 8:00 PM at the PIT Underground (123 E. 24th St.). My house team REGINA performs its weekly house team show, with our friends Poor Melissa.

**REGINA** (at the NYC Improv Festival): Wednesday, March 22nd (the day after the day after tomorrow!), 9PM at the PIT Striker Theater (123 E. 24th St.) with The Studio System.

**THE HUMANE CENTIPEDE** (at the NYC Improv Festival): Thursday, March 23rd (the day after the day after the day after tomorrow!), 11 PM at the PIT LOFT (154 W. 29th St., betw. 6th and 7th Ave.). It&#8217;s the WORLD PREMIERE of the improv and sketch group featuring some of my most talented bestest best friends, Adrian Sexton and Rory Scholl.

**GEORGE/MARTHA** (at the NYC Improv Festival): Saturday, March 25th (the day after the&#8230; oh forget it&#8230; a week from today), at 4 PM at the PIT LOFT (154 W. 29th St., betw. 6th and 7th Ave.). I play Richard Burton playing George, and Adrian Sexton plays Elizabeth Taylor playing Martha, as we improvise a brand new &#8220;Who&#8217;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&#8221; There will be much drinking and anger, especially if the estate of Edward Albee hears about it&#8230;

**THE AUSTEN FAMILY IMPROV PLAYERS** (at the NYC Improv Festival): Saturday, March 25th (the same day as the last one!), at 9 PM at the PIT LOFT (don&#8217;t you know where it is by now?). We are an improvisational theatrical troupe from 1813, performing in the style of Miss Jane Austen. With a little luck and some providence, we may all be profitably married by the end of the show!

Whew! Hopefully I&#8217;ll still be alive at the end of all this&#8230;
