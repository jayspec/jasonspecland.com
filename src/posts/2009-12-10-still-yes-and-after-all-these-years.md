Last night, I attended my penultimate level 1 improv class at The Pit. One of the consequences of having a class is having a class show at the end of the term. For the first time last night, we practiced doing the actual form we&#8217;ll be performing in our show. After being kind of down about my performance ability last week, I was actually quite encouraged.

We&#8217;re still a bit rough around the edges, but I think that (by level 1 standards) we&#8217;ll put on a solid show. For much of the rest of the class, it will be a possibly terrifying learning experience. For me, it will be getting back on a saddle that had been long collecting dust in a closet. This is the first time that I&#8217;ve performed improv on a public stage as part of a real team in 8 years.

Please come, won&#8217;t you?
