I haven&#8217;t done an &#8220;Awesome Things my Friends are Doing&#8221; post in a while. It&#8217;s not because my friends aren&#8217;t doing awesome things. They not only do them, but they do them at quite astonishing frequency. I&#8217;ve just been lazy in relating the awesomeness to you. For that, I apologize.

But, I hope to make all that up to you now, by posting this: The Vo Vo Voting Song, by my musical improv teacher and mentor (and host of Marvel&#8217;s &#8220;The Watcher,&#8221; and inexhaustible source of awesomeness) Lorraine Cink and my East Side Orphan Riot teammate (and PITch host, and musical writer, and similarly physics-defying source of awesome) Ryan Dunkin.



I think it&#8217;s fun to watch their lips as they pronounce those runs of &#8220;vo&#8221; sounds.
