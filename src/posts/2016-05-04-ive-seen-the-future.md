Well, by now every SharePoint person on Earth has seen and blogged about the #FutureOfSharePoint announcement. Most of the top SharePoint bloggers have just been sitting on all this until today, but I run in far humbler circles.

So let&#8217;s look at what I wanted, and what I got:

> A Master Page that&#8217;s responsive and compatible with modern web design sensibilities. Microsoft has warned us against modifying it, lest we pay the &#8220;modification tax,&#8221; but our clients keep saying, &#8220;Responsive, responsive, responsive.&#8221; You&#8217;ve got to meet us half-way.
> 
> Office Dev PnP Tooling (or something like it) baked in to Visual Studio just as well as the Feature Framework tooling was baked in to VS 2012/2013. And while we&#8217;re on the subject, can we please have some less roundabout ways to get things done? As much as I love Vesa Juvonen and the work he and his team have done, this needs to have some real Microsoft institutional oomph behind it.
> 
> And while we&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s have a better story for client-side, non-App/Add-in-oriented development. SharePoint 2013 is approaching the sunset and 2016 is being born, and I&#8217;ve still yet to actually write an app for a client. They don&#8217;t want to set up that infrastructure, and if they have no intention of adding untrusted stuff from the internet they shouldn&#8217;t have to. 

**Got it, got it, got it. I&#8217;m so psyched for the SharePoint Framework, I can barely contain myself.**

> Okay, this isn&#8217;t SharePoint so much, but what&#8217;s the deal with javascript Intellisense in an Angular app in Visual Studio? Eh, it won&#8217;t be much of an issue for me in the future, since after recently completing a moderately large javascript project, I now solemnly swear to use Typescript forever and ever, amen.

**They explicitly showed people using the SharePoint Framework using VS Code. More modern &#8220;cool&#8221; tools, less monolithic IDEs. Nice.**

> Either integrate Yammer like you promised or get rid of the damn thing. I was at the SharePoint Conference in Vegas where they announced the acquisition, and the two products seem no better integrated today than they were then. SharePoint 2013 could have been the launchpad from which real Office Social Networking took off, but instead Microsoft strangled it with a garrote from the back seat of a late 70&#8217;s model sedan.
> 
> Some kind of way forward for InfoPath! Surely when it comes to something as basic to human business life as forms, there must be _some_ happy medium between &#8220;let&#8217;s use an end-of-life&#8217;d technology that no one at Microsoft will touch with a ten foot pole&#8221; and &#8220;time to write another fat check to that javascript developer!&#8221; Sure I&#8217;m usually the javascript developer they write that fat check to, but I _do_ have some sympathy for my clients.

**Nope. Yammer and InfoPath are still dead as disco. Sorry, Tessio. It&#8217;s just business.**

> A device that sends an electric shock to any person who attempts to use SharePoint as a relational database back-end for a super-customized, nowhere-near-the-box, not-at-all-like-SharePoint front-end. Yes, this device would probably kill me, but my smoking corpse could serve as a warning to others&#8230;

**Not only did I not get this, but the SharePoint Framework will probably encourage me to do more of that type of development. It&#8217;s probably best for my health anyway.**
