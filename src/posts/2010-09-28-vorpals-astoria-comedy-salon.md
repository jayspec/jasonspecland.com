This past Saturday was the &#8220;Through the Laughing Glass&#8221; show at Wonderland. It was really kind of cool. They have a huge space with a white cyclorama that served as our stage, and we made the rows out of their eclectic collection of chairs and couches. From the audience, it had kind of the feel of a comedy salon rather than a show. But with the stage, light, and mic setup it was all very professional from the stage. It was just a super-groovy, intimate space.

All of the acts were great, but a couple of them just plain killed. I don&#8217;t think we were among the killers, but I think we put in a solid performance. We&#8217;re definitely getting there. Beyond just the high of performing, though, it was exciting to be the hosts of a real up-and-coming comedy gathering. All praise goes to Kathryn for pulling it all together.

As promised, the party that was to follow, did. You know it&#8217;s a great party when a random hula-hoop contest breaks out. My favorite part of the party was when people were drunkenly pitching their ideas for new improv forms at each other. It&#8217;s just that kind of critical mass of creativity that has the potential to explode all over the improv performance world. It just takes one spark&#8230;

With that in mind, we&#8217;re going to try and make this a monthly deal. We&#8217;re going to try and make this a comedy destination where people can gather, laugh, enjoy themselves, and try things out away from the bright spotlights of Manhattan.

Hopefully, one day soon, we will be the ones to kill&#8230;
