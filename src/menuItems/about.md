Jason Specland is a teacher and performer of improv comedy with over 25 years of experience on stage.  He is also a software architect, a public speaker, and a father who lives in New York City. He grew up in South Florida, where he hosted a retro-80&#8217;s radio show in the early 1990&#8217;s when no one cared. He once worked at a grocery store, where for some reason he agreed to dress up in a Barney the Dinosaur costume to amuse the kids.

Jason is a teacher and performer of improv comedy with over 25 years of experience on stage. He’s also a husband, a dad, and a huge tech nerd who lives in New York City.
