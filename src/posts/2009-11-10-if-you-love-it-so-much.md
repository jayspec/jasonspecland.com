In life, I believe, you&#8217;re allowed to marry one person, and one foodstuff.  Almost six years ago, I made the wonderfully fateful decision to marry Paula Galloway and I couldn&#8217;t be happier.  I have not, however, been able to commit to a foodstuff as completely and unabashedly as I have to a woman.

Until now&#8230;

I am hereby announcing my intent to food-marry.  I will be married to the Twice Cooked Pork Belly with Leeks lunch special at Szechuan Gourmet, on 39th St.  The ceremony will take place some time next week, at my desk at work, as I fill my belly once again with its wonderful spicy, fatty, porkiness.  We have registered (appropriately enough) at Szechuan Gourmet and unsurprisingly, we have only registered for more plates of Twice Cooked Pork Belly with Leeks.  Recursvie?  Yes.  But delicious.
