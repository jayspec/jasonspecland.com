Two contrasting things I&#8217;ve been into lately:

1. I&#8217;ve been trying to dress nicely. With my collection of tee shirts, jeans, and khakis for work I was feeling a bit like I was still dressing like a teenager. First I went shopping at Macy&#8217;s. (Well, first I went to Bloomingdale&#8217;s, saw a pair of pants that cost more than my rent, and left.) Then, and I know I&#8217;m so late to this party that I arrived just as the dishes were being put away, I discovered eBay. In any case, I&#8217;ve been putting on nicer clothes lately.

2. At work I&#8217;ve been doing a long, miserable slog through my database that involves a lot of manual labor and almost no actual creativity. To pass the time, I&#8217;ve set Pandora to blast my face with Heavy Metal for hours on end. There&#8217;s something about the unending repetition of face-melting power chords that allows me to concentrate.

So, if you need me, I&#8217;ll be the guy in the corner in the jacket and tie listening to Metallica.
