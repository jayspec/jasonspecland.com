[Study: Athletes Perform Better Under Pressure When They Make a Fist With Their Left Hand](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/study-athletes-perform-better-under-pressure-when-they-make-a-fist-with-their-left-hand/262605/)

Apparently, the act of squeezing your left hand focuses the activity on the right hemisphere of your brain. The right hemisphere is focused on the mechanics of taking action. It also disengages the left hemisphere, which is where &#8220;freaking out under pressure&#8221; is concentrated.

Can this work for improvisers? It might be impractical to justify why you&#8217;re making a fist all the time. But maybe I&#8217;ll give it a try once or twice and see&#8230;
