Nothing about the &#8220;Future of SharePoint&#8221; here. That&#8217;s been covered to death.

[Making Your REST Calls Simpler by Changing the Metadata Setting](http://sympmarc.com/2016/05/02/making-your-rest-calls-simpler-by-changing-the-metadata-setting/?utm_content=bufferc8614) by Marc D. Anderson (sympmarc). Help your SharePoint REST calls be a little less &#8220;chatty.&#8221; But, as Anders Austad points out, it [must be enabled for use on-prem](http://www.andersaustad.com/using-json-light-with-on-premise-sharepoint-2013/). (Also, it requires SharePoint 2013 Service Pack 1. You _are_ on SP1 by now, right?)

[FREE Office365 and AzureAD for Developers course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/office365dev/?utm_content=buffera572e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) by Sahil Malik. Haven&#8217;t gone through it myself yet (it&#8217;s 7.5 hours long) but the source is an extremely well-trusted one.

[Death by GPS, at Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/death-by-gps/). People blindly follow technology, get into trouble. Film at 11.
