I am very fortunate to have married an extremely talented and beautiful woman. You, too, can have a tiny fraction of that fortunateness rub off on you.

&#8220;How can I get even the tiniest bit of that supernova of awesomeness to rub off upon me?&#8221; I hear you ask.

I will tell you: Her band, The Icky House Club, is performing this Friday at Don&#8217;t Tell Mama.

You&#8230; don&#8217;t believe me? You will, Doctor Jones. Or, to reference another 80&#8217;s movie entirely: You know that new sound you&#8217;re looking for? Well listen to this!

[The Icky House Club on Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/ickyhouseclub). (Please note that I&#8217;m posting a link to a musician, the only valid use of Myspace in the year 2010.)

Now that you&#8217;ve been infected by their infectious infectiousness, here are the [relevant concert details from Don&#8217;t Tell Mama](http://www.donttellmamanyc.com/eventdetails.php?day=12&month=11&year=2010&eid=2277).

I&#8217;d tell you to buy your tickets now, but according to the link they&#8217;re only accepting cash at the door. So what you should do is this: Get a Ball mason jar, put an Avery or Brother P-Touch label upon it that reads, &#8220;Icky House Club, Friday November 12, 9:15 PM,&#8221; and put $20 in the jar to cover admission and the two drink minimum. By the time Friday rolls around, it&#8217;ll be like found money! Woo hoo!
