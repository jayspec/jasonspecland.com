On Wednesday, the team that will shortly be renamed but is currently known as Team Green performed their first show at The PIT. I alluded to how it felt in a brief Facebook status update*, but the feeling was so intense that I needed to record it here.

It. Was. Amazing.

Even though the theater is brand new, between open jams and auditions I&#8217;d been on the stage plenty of times by now. But when the house is full, as it was Wednesday, the energy is just entirely different. The stage was electric. The laughter fell over us like an intoxicating tidal wave. It was a feeling I haven&#8217;t felt since&#8230; well&#8230; the last time I had a major role in a show before a huge, full house. (Rocky Horror? We didn&#8217;t quite sell that out. Ragtime? My part was comparatively minor.)

There were certainly some rough patches. We&#8217;re still kind of feeling each other out, finding our group mind. We&#8217;d never even rehearsed before, for goodness sake! But based on the positive response we got on our first time out, I&#8217;ve got a feeling we&#8217;ve got a lot of amazing performances ahead of us.

<font size=-5>* I find myself experiencing a strange hierarchy of &#8220;publishing thoughts on the Internet.&#8221; I&#8217;ll start on Twitter, where I will try and lovingly trim my thoughts down to 140 characters. If I absolutely can&#8217;t trim it that far, it goes to Facebook. Then, when I finally feel the need for paragraphs and permanence, it ends up here.</font>
