As many of you may have noticed\* I have been kind of quiet as of late\**. Well the very big reason for that is because I&#8217;ve been busy hunting for a new job.

I&#8217;ve just completed my very first week as a Cloud Solution Architect for Microsoft. I am absolutely over-the-moon excited about this amazing opportunity. I&#8217;m still drinking from the firehose of figuring out this enormous company and my role in it, but thus far everyone&#8217;s been absolutely delightful.

\* No one noticed, because no one reads this blog. It&#8217;s just for me.  
\** I also almost never post on it, so how would you (which is to say no one) ever know if I was quiet or not?
