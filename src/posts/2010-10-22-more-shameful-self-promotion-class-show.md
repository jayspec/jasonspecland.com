Can&#8217;t make it to Astoria for Vorpal&#8217;s Halloween show? Think $10 is too much to pay? Worried that seeing Vorpal on the stage without other non-Vorpalians to dilute their awesome improv powers will cause your face to melt like the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark?

Well then, have I got a show for you. In fact, I have _two_ shows for you!

Our Level 5 improv class will be performing two class shows. These shows contain four out of five members of Vorpal, so it&#8217;s almost like going to a Vorpal show, only with other people who just happened to also pay for this particular class.

But this particular class is no ordinary class. It is taught by PIT Master Ali Farahnakian. Or as I like to call him when I&#8217;m writing about him online, Ali Cut-and-Pastian. Will the students come full circle and defeat their master? Almost certainly not, but gee, if that happened, wouldn&#8217;t it be great to be there to see it?

Show the First: Sunday, October 24th, 7 P.M.  
Show the Second: Monday, November 8th, 8 P.M.

As always, the shows will be at:  
The People&#8217;s Improv Theater  
154 W. 29th St., between 6th and 7th Ave.

And, as always, the shows will set you back:
