**SECRET INFINITY CRISIS OF CHAMPIONS, Thursday, May 3, 9:30, The PIT**  
Some of Earth&#8217;s mightiest heroes (and many of the not-quite-so-mightiest heroes) have been transported from their home worlds by the evil Mojo, and will be forced to face mankind&#8217;s greatest fear: performing improv. I will be playing the role of Mojo, the producer and extra-dimensional puppet master.

**THE AUSTEN FAMILY PLAYERS, Wednesday, May 9, 8:00, The PIT LOFT**  
A troupe of English improvisers has been transported from the year 1813, and they are most delighted to be making their debut performance on Yankee soil. They will dazzle you with a montage of such characters and scenes as are certain to divert you famously, and your evening will be well spent in gazing upon their fine countenances as they engage in charades for your express entertainment. I will most likely be portraying a rakish bachelor of considerable wealth who is most desirous to marry a proper lady equal to my station.
