Recently, Benjamin&#8217;s made kind of a quantum leap in his development. Before, he wouldn&#8217;t pick up a pen or pencil for anything. Now, he absolutely loves to write and draw. His drawings have quickly evolved from random scribbles, to actual discernable shapes, to recognizable themes and extreme cuteness.

With that in mind, I now designate this blog as my virtual refrigerator. Behold! The art of Benjamin Specland!

[<img src="http://jasonspecland.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/music-300x218.jpg" alt="" title="music" width="300" height="218" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-294" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/music-300x218.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/02/music-1024x744.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://jasonspecland.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/music.jpg)

This one he calls, &#8220;Music.&#8221; The lowercase b things are musical notes. (I guess he&#8217;s fond of the half-note.)

The person in the middle is Benjamin, playing the piano. At the bottom is me playing guitar, and Paula playing the tambourine.
