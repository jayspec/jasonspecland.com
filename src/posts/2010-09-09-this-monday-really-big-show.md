So Vorpal&#8217;s first big show is approaching. All the usual promo stuff is below. But since this blog is primarily read by my friends, I wanted to point out something important:

Kelly Nichols is going to be one of our opening acts!

I&#8217;m seriously super-psyched about this. Kelly is so charming, brilliant, and hysterical. She doesn&#8217;t just warm up the crowd, she bakes them in a cozy oven at 350 degrees for twenty minutes until the whole theater smells like pumpkin pie. With her getting things started, the hilarity is ours to lose.

And now, the important, but not personal, info:

This is it folks! The big show! This Monday! 9:30 PM! At the PIT! $5!

For one frakked up night, members of Vorpal emerge from their parents&#8217; basement to bring you the geekiest nerd-fest since Stephen Hawking and Gary Gygax discovered the universe was encapsulated entirely within an enormous twenty sided die. By the power of Grayskull, WE ARE VORPAL! Up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A-Select-START!

VORPAL is Kathryn Dunn, Colin Longstaff, Jason Specland, Than Bryan, Daniel Operman, and Mary Guiteras. 

With Extraordinarily Special Guests:

Erin Lennox, stand-up comedian, freelance writer, and freelance judger of others, featured in the PIT&#8217;s &#8220;Smart Women.&#8221; 

Kelly Nichols, stand-up comedian, writer, and star of the musical romp about lack-of-romping &#8220;Ten Reasons I Won&#8217;t Go Home With You.&#8221;

BAY-SIDE, The deliciously dynamic improv duo of AJ Ortiz and Patrick Cucuta.

Together we will rock you so hard that geologists will have to recalibrate the Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness to account for this new hard rocking! We will raise the roof so high that architects and civil engineers in the audience may become concerned for the structural integrity of the building! Be there! Please?
