So, my fledgling improv team, &#8220;Jabberwocky&#8221; has changed its name to the similarly sourced &#8220;Vorpal.&#8221; &#8220;Vorpal&#8221; sounds faster, and everyone knows that the most important property of an improv team name is how fast it sounds.

In addition to a fast-sounding name, you need promotional photos with actors in silly poses. Fortunately, I&#8217;ve got the camera equipment, and fellow troupe member Colin lives in a magical Wonderland with a huge white cyc wall. Silly poses, ahoy!

We&#8217;ve been booking shows at a very scary pace for a brand new troupe. We&#8217;ve hit the ground running! Our upcoming shows are:

Monday, August 9, 2010, 8:00 PM  
Wonderland Collective  
38-01 23rd Ave., Astoria (Between 38th St. and Steinway, above Astoria Sound Works)  
FREE! (This show is just kind of a warm-up in front of a friendly audience, and get a clean promotional video. If you&#8217;re poor and live in Astoria, this is the show for you!)

Friday, August 20, 2010, <strike>10:00 PM</strike> 10:30 PM  
Sparks  
Hm, it just occurred to me that I have no idea where this one actually is. I guess I&#8217;ll need to find out before I promote it. Watch this space! ðŸ™‚
