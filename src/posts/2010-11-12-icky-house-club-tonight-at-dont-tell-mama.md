Hey, folks! It occurred to me that some of you might not be aware of how lovely and talented my wife is. Your honor, I&#8217;d like to submit People&#8217;s Exhibit A, the following You Tube video. The quality&#8217;s not great, they&#8217;re short on microphones, and they&#8217;ve since acquired a bass player. But the awesomeness still shines through like the too-bright morning sun through sheer curtains the morning after too much alcohol.



Remember that mason jar I asked you to fill with $20? Well, bust it open now. Hey, look! Found money! Might as well use it to go see the Icky House Club&#8230;
