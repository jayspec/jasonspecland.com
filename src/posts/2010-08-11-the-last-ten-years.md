Ten years ago today, I was in a Hudson Shakespeare production of &#8220;Much Ado About Nothing.&#8221; Their Verges had dropped out. Duncan, who was playing Dogberry, recommended me as a replacement. 

The woman playing Beatrice was someone I&#8217;d met a few times before. The first time I met her, she&#8217;d auditioned for an improv troupe I was in. She did not get cast. The second time, I auditioned for a role in a production of &#8220;The Fantasticks&#8221; that she was assistant directing. I did not get cast.

But now we were cast together, and we were getting to know each other quite well. There were a few knowing glances. A few casual hand touches. Some definite sparks.

One sunny afternoon after rehearsal, this woman&#8230; let&#8217;s call her Paula&#8230; stated that she was going to the Newport Center Mall after rehearsal to buy a new jean jacket. So desperate was I to spend more time with her that I volunteered to go with her. As we departed the mall and were about to go our separate ways, she suggested we stop at Starbucks for a frappuccino. We drank our frappuccinos by the Hudson River piers at Newport. We made small talk. Small talk became deep talk. Suddenly, we began to kiss.

&#8220;Are you asking me out?&#8221; she asked.  
&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221; I replied.  
&#8220;Well you&#8217;d better do it right.&#8221;

I officially asked her out on a date.

On that date, ten years ago tonight, we had dinner at Da Rosina on Restaurant Row and then went to see Brian Stokes Mitchell in &#8220;Kiss Me Kate.&#8221; It was torrentially raining when we met, so we had to hide for a while under the awning of the church in which they were doing &#8220;Tony and Tina&#8217;s Wedding.&#8221; But that evening after &#8220;Kiss Me Kate&#8221; the weather was clear enough for us to walk over to Bryant Park and make out.

Yes, technically our wedding anniversary is the more important one. But I will never forget the night ten years ago, when I had a spectacularly successful first date with the love of my life.
