Tomorrow&#8217;s the big show at Wonderland! Seriously, folks, I think you should all come see it. It&#8217;s not just Vorpal, but a whole bunch of other awesome performers including:

Bay-Side  
Fuct  
The Dream  
John F Oâ€™Donnell  
Martin Sheen Shower Hour

Not only will the comedy be awesome, but there will be a Halloween party, too! Spooky decor, oddly colored booze, haunting music, the whole nine.

$10. $8 if you&#8217;re in costume.

What?

You&#8217;re still not coming?

You&#8217;re going to make me whip out the big guns:

Right now, as I type this, Paula is making pumpkin cupcakes.

I thought so. See you tomorrow at 7.
